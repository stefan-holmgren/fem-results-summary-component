## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I chose to use javascript, because I saw the `data.json` file, so I thought "what the hey". Created a `template` element and used it to create a `documentFragment` to append to the DOM.
